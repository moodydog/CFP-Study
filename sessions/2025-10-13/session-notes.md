## Questions Asked

### Question 1: Social Security Filing Decision - Early vs. FRA vs. Delayed

**Student's Question**: Client age 62 retired, debating filing now vs FRA (67). Spouse age 60, doesn't work. Why delay until FRA? Options: A) Spouse not 62, B) Earning $12k part-time, C) Good health/longevity, D) Portfolio income makes SS taxable

**Student's Answer**: C - Good health/longevity ✓ CORRECT

**Initial Understanding**:
- Knew early filing reduces benefits by percentage per year
- **MAJOR MISCONCEPTION**: Thought benefits are flat after FRA (didn't know about delayed retirement credits)
- Very confused about spouse benefits and requirements
- Unclear on earnings test and how it works
- Vague understanding of SS taxation ("add up something")
- Wanted to deeply understand ALL concepts in the question

**Explanation Given**:

**Social Security Timeline:**
- **Age 62-67 (Early)**: ~5-7% reduction per year (30% total at 62)
- **Age 67 (FRA)**: 100% of benefit
- **Age 67-70 (Delayed)**: 8% increase per year (24% total at 70)
- **After 70**: No more increases

**Earnings Test (Before FRA):**
- If file before FRA AND still working → benefits reduced if earnings exceed limit
- 2024 limit: $22,320 (lose $1 for every $2 over)
- At or after FRA: NO earnings test - can earn unlimited with no penalty
- Client earning $12k < $22,320 → no reduction
- Answer B wrong because under threshold

**Spousal Benefits:**
- Spouse can get up to 50% of worker's FRA benefit
- Requirements: 1) Spouse age 62+, 2) Worker must have filed
- Client's spouse age 60 → must wait 2 more years
- If client delays to 67, spouse waits 5 more years total
- Answer A wrong - spouse being 60 is reason to file SOONER, not delay

**SS Taxation:**
- Combined income = AGI + tax-exempt interest + 50% of SS
- Thresholds: <$32k (married) = 0%, $32k-$44k = up to 50%, >$44k = up to 85%
- Taxation same regardless of filing age
- Answer D wrong - not a reason to delay

**Longevity & Break-Even:**
- Parents in 90s, good health = likely long life
- Break-even ~age 78-80
- Delaying gives higher monthly benefit for life
- Answer C CORRECT - valid reason to delay

**Comprehension Checks:**

1. If FRA benefit = $2,000/month, what at age 62 and 70?
   - Student's answer: Age 62 ~$1,400 (30% reduction), Age 70 $2,480 (24% increase) ✓ CORRECT
   - Showed good understanding of percentage calculations

2. Can someone earning millions after FRA get full Social Security?
   - Student's understanding: "If you file after FRA, you can make millions and still get full SS with zero punishment" ✓ PERFECT
   - Correctly distinguished filing for SS vs retiring from work as independent decisions

3. Why is spouse age 60 NOT a reason to delay?
   - Initial answer: "It's a good reason to delay because spouse can't benefit yet" ✗ WRONG
   - After explanation: Understood that delaying makes spouse wait LONGER (5 years vs 2 years)
   - Key insight: Worker must file before spouse can collect spousal benefits

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Major breakthrough on multiple fronts:
- Corrected misconception about delayed retirement credits
- Now understands earnings test completely
- Grasps spousal benefit requirements
- Understands SS taxation basics
- Can think through timeline implications

**Key Learning**: This question touched on 4+ major Social Security rules - excellent deep-dive approach by student

### Question 2: Retirement Plan Types - 403(b), 457(b), 457(f), IRA Comparison

**Student's Question**: Teacher's assistant age 52, earns $25k. Which plan allows maximum contribution? Options: Roth IRA, 403(b), Traditional IRA, 457(f)

**Student's Answer**: 403(b) ✓ CORRECT

**Initial Understanding**:
- Knew IRAs have ~$7,000 limit
- Knew there are "government plans" like 403(b) and 457
- Did NOT remember specific limits or requirements for employer plans
- Confused about which plans apply to which employers
- Didn't know difference between 457(b) vs 457(f)
- Said "I just don't remember all these government teacher retirement plans"

**Explanation Given**:

**Four Categories of Retirement Plans:**
1. Individual (IRAs) - Anyone with earned income
2. For-profit companies (401k)
3. Non-profit & education (403b)
4. Government (457b, 457f)

**2024 Contribution Limits:**

**IRAs:**
- Base: $7,000
- Age 50+ catch-up: +$1,000
- Total age 52: **$8,000**

**401(k), 403(b), 457(b) - ALL IDENTICAL:**
- Base: $23,000
- Age 50+ catch-up: +$7,500
- Total age 52: **$30,500**
- Limited by compensation (this client: $25,000)

**This Problem:**
- IRA max: $8,000
- 403(b) max: $25,000 (limited by income)
- 403(b) wins: $25,000 vs $8,000

**457(b) vs 457(f) Distinction:**

**457(b) - Government Deferred Comp:**
- For state/local government employees
- Same limits as 401k/403b: $23k + $7.5k
- Special: Last 3 years can double contribution
- No 10% early withdrawal penalty
- **Can max out BOTH 457(b) AND 401k/403b simultaneously**

**457(f) - Executive Golden Handcuffs:**
- For top executives at government/non-profit only
- NO dollar limit (unlimited deferral)
- Substantial risk of forfeiture (lose if leave early)
- Unfunded (employer holds money, you're just creditor)
- If employer insolvent/bankrupt → you lose it
- Answer D wrong: Teacher's assistant not top executive

**Key Insight Student Made:**
"Essentially all these 403 numbers are identical to 401k... it's the 401k for private sector"
✓ EXCELLENT - Correctly identified the pattern

**Comprehension Checks:**

1. Corrected RMD age: 73 (not 72.5) for born 1951-1959
2. Calculated IRA with catch-up: $7k + $1k = $8k ✓
3. Understood 403(b) limited by $25k compensation
4. Made key connection: 401k/403b/457b all same limits, just different employers
5. Asked clarifying question about 457f: "Is it company or government?" - showed critical thinking
6. Understood 457b can be stacked with 403b/401k (asked follow-up to confirm)

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Went from knowing "there are government plans" to understanding the entire retirement plan landscape and how they relate to each other.

**Key Learning Gap Filled**: Now has clear framework for all major retirement plan types and their limits.

### Question 3: Keogh Plans (HR-10) for Self-Employed

**Student's Question**: Couple age 40, unincorporated business, net income (after ½ SE tax) $70k, contribute $3k each to IRAs. Maximum Keogh contribution?

**Student's Answer**: Not initially answered - didn't know what Keogh plan was

**Correct Answer**: B) $14,000

**Initial Understanding**:
- ✓ Understood "unincorporated business" = self-employed (partnership/sole prop)
- ✓ Roughly understood self-employment tax adjustment
- ✗ Didn't know what Keogh plan was ("I don't know what's the Q plan")
- Guessed that IRA contributions would reduce Keogh limit (incorrect)

**Explanation Given**:

**Self-Employment Tax Clarification:**
- Self-employed pay both sides of SS/Medicare (15.3% total)
- Can deduct "employer half" (7.65%) when calculating income
- This is why we subtract "one half of SE tax"

**Keogh Plan (HR-10):**
- Retirement plan for self-employed individuals
- Also called HR-10 plan (same thing)
- Can be profit-sharing, money purchase pension, or defined benefit
- Most common: Profit-sharing Keogh

**Contribution Calculation:**
- For regular employees: Up to 25% of W-2 wages
- For self-employed: **20% of adjusted net self-employment income**
- Due to IRS circular calculation, 25% becomes 20% for self-employed

**This Problem:**
- Net income (after ½ SE tax): $70,000
- IRA contributions: $6,000 total (doesn't affect Keogh)
- Keogh max: 20% × $70,000 = **$14,000**

**Overall Limit:**
- $66,000 for 2024, $69,000 for 2025
- Caps the contribution even with high income

**Keogh vs IRA:**
- Completely separate limits
- Can contribute to both simultaneously
- IRA contributions don't reduce Keogh limit

**Comprehension Checks:**

1. If net income was $100,000, what's max Keogh?
   - Student's answer: 0.2 × 100 = $20,000 ✓ PERFECT
   - Applied formula correctly

2. Can self-employed contribute to BOTH Keogh AND IRA same year?
   - Student's answer: Yes ✓ CORRECT

**Understanding Level**: EXCELLENT - Went from zero knowledge to fully understanding calculation and relationship to IRAs.

**Key Learning**: Keogh = 20% for self-employed (not 25%), separate from IRA limits.

### Question 4: Homeowners Insurance - Special Limits and Floaters

**Student's Question**: Family has HO-2 coverage, $200k dwelling, $100k personal property. Have jewelry ($10k), fur ($4k), coins ($3k), computer in dorm ($1.2k). Which need additional coverage?

**Student's Answer**: Not initially answered

**Correct Answer**: B) Jewelry, fur coat, and coin collection only

**Initial Understanding**:
- "The whole HO insurance and coverage items are very confused to me"
- Heard of HO-3, HO-4 but didn't remember what they mean
- Knew about ABCD coverages but forgot details
- Understood 80% rule concept: "Insurance must cover 80% of replacement cost, otherwise proportionally less" ✓ CORRECT
- Understood insurance replaces at replacement cost

**Explanation Given**:

**HO Policy Types:**
- HO-2: Named perils (lists what's covered) - this problem
- HO-3: Most common, open perils (covers all except exclusions)
- HO-4: Renters (no dwelling coverage)
- HO-6: Condo owners (walls-in coverage)

**Coverage Types (A, B, C, D):**
- A - Dwelling ($200k in problem)
- B - Other Structures (usually 10% of A)
- C - Personal Property (usually 50% of A; $100k in problem)
- D - Loss of Use (usually 20% of A)

**80% Coinsurance Rule:**
- Must insure for at least 80% of replacement cost
- If not, payment = (Insurance Carried / Insurance Required) × Loss - Deductible
- Student's understanding was correct

**Special Limits (KEY CONCEPT):**
- Jewelry, furs, watches: $1,500 limit
- Coins, money, stamps: $200 limit
- Firearms: $2,500
- Silverware/goldware: $2,500
- Business property: $2,500
- Property away from home: 10% of Coverage C

**This Problem:**
- Jewelry ($10k) > $1,500 limit → Need floater ✗
- Fur ($4k) > $1,500 limit → Need floater ✗
- Coins ($3k) > $200 limit → Need floater ✗
- Computer in dorm ($1.2k) < 10% × $100k = $10k → OK ✓

**Memory Tricks Provided:**
- "$1,500 Club": Fancy stuff that people steal (jewelry, furs)
- "$2,500 Club": Metal stuff and work stuff (guns, silver, business)
- "$200": Cash drawer limit (money, coins)
- "10% rule": Property away from home

**Understanding Level**: GOOD - Initially very confused about insurance, but grasped the key patterns:
- Different items have sub-limits despite overall coverage
- 10% rule for property away from home
- Need floaters when value exceeds sub-limits

**Key Learning**: Homeowners insurance has special limits on certain categories that are much lower than overall personal property coverage.
